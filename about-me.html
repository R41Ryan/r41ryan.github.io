    <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        <p>
            I am a Software Engineer from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I graduated from the University of Calgary with a
            Bachelor's Degree of Science in Software Engineering in May 2024.
            During my program, I worked on a variety of projects, both as part of an assignment and as a personal
            project done during my free time.
            You can view my projects in the <a>Projects</a> page. <br><br>
            I have a passion for game development and artificial intelligence, but I'm open to developing software of
            any kind because, to me, there's a kind of magic to writing software such that
            designing and writing code in general is enjoyable.
        </p>
